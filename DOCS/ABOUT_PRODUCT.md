Email 3: Problem-Solution (10 days later)

Subject: Why backlink building is broken (and how we're fixing it)

Hi {first_name},

Let's be honest: the current way of building backlinks is completely broken.

You're forced to:
- Spend hours manually searching for websites
- Dig through pages trying to find contact information
- Send dozens of emails with minimal response
- Guess which sites are worth your time

It's inefficient, frustrating, and time-consuming.

That's exactly why we built SEO Backlink Builder. We've automated the entire prospecting process so you can focus on what matters: creating connections and growing your business.

With just 2 weeks until launch, we've added another special bonus for waitlist members: A free 30-minute strategy call with our SEO team to help you maximize your results.

Can't wait to get this in your hands!
