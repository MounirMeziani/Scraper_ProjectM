# Backend Documentation

## Backend Framework
- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js  
  *Rationale:* Node.js with Express.js is cost-effective, widely adopted, and scales well. Its non-blocking I/O model and robust ecosystem make it ideal for building RESTful APIs and handling asynchronous operations, such as web scraping and email extraction.

## API Design
- **Approach:** RESTful API design with versioning  
  *Rationale:*  
  - **RESTful APIs** are straightforward, scalable, and widely understood.
  - **Versioning:** We'll use URL versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) to ensure future enhancements can be introduced without breaking existing integrations.
  - **Naming Conventions:** Standard, resource-oriented naming conventions will be applied (e.g., `/api/v1/articles`, `/api/v1/users`) for clarity and consistency.

## Authentication and Authorization
- **Approach:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) combined with Passport.js for multiple authentication strategies  
  *Rationale:*  
  - **Email/Password Authentication:** Provides a traditional and secure way for users to create accounts and log in.  
  - **Social Logins:** Incorporating social authentication (e.g., Google, Facebook) offers users convenience and can help increase sign-up rates.  
  - **Passport.js:** This library supports a wide range of authentication strategies, making it a versatile choice for implementing both email/password and social logins.  
  - **JWT:** Once authenticated, JWTs will be used to securely manage sessions in a stateless manner.

## Third-Party Integrations

- **Web Scraping:**  
  To keep costs low and use free, open-source solutions, we suggest the following:
  - **Cheerio:** A fast, lightweight library for parsing HTML and traversing the DOM in Node.js. It works similarly to jQuery and is ideal for extracting content from static pages.
  - **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client to make HTTP requests and retrieve webpage content.
  - **Puppeteer (Optional):** For cases where target websites rely heavily on JavaScript to render content, Puppeteer (a headless Chrome Node API) can be used. It is open-source and free, though more resource-intensive compared to Cheerio.
  
- **Email Extraction:**  
  - Utilize simple regular expressions (regex) within Node.js to locate and extract email addresses from the scraped content.  
  - Alternatively, consider using lightweight libraries such as **email-extractor** if additional parsing features are needed.

- **Content Analysis:**  
  - Incorporate natural language processing (NLP) tools (e.g., Natural, compromise.js, or external NLP APIs) to extract keywords, subjects, and themes from user-submitted articles.

## Database
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose ODM  
  *Rationale:*  
  - **MongoDB** is a flexible, NoSQL document-based database that stores data in JSON-like documents.  
  - **Mongoose** provides an ODM layer to enforce schemas and validations, ensuring that documents are consistently formatted when passed across various modules (web scraping, content analysis, email extraction, etc.).  
  - This combination allows for rapid development and scalability while maintaining structured data flow throughout the application.
