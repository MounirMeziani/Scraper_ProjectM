# Frontend Documentation

## UI Framework
- **Framework:** React.js  
  *Rationale:* React.js is widely adopted and has a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries, making it an excellent choice for building scalable web applications.

## UI Library
- **Library:** Shadcn UI  
  *Rationale:* Shadcn UI provides a collection of modern pre-built components that integrate seamlessly with React.js, speeding up development and ensuring design consistency.

## Navigation
- **Approach:** Side Navigation Menu  
  *Rationale:* A side navigation menu offers clear organization of different sections (e.g., Dashboard, Results, Settings), is intuitive for users, and scales well as the application grows. It can also adapt responsively by collapsing into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

## Styling
- **Approach:** Tailwind CSS  
  *Rationale:* Tailwind CSS is a modern, utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with a clean, attractive design. Its flexibility and ease of integration with React and Shadcn UI make it an excellent choice for our project.

## Forms

- **User Authentication Forms:**  
  - **Sign-Up Form:** Allows new users to create an account by providing essential details (e.g., email, password, and optionally a username).  
  - **Login Form:** Enables existing users to log in using their email/username and password.  
  - **Password Recovery:** (Optional) Provides a mechanism for users to reset their password if forgotten.

- **Article Submission Form:**  
  - **Text Area:** A large text box where users can paste their SEO article.  
  - **Additional Fields:** Optionally include a field for the article title or a brief description if needed.  
  - **Submission Action:** A submit button that triggers the content analysis process.

## State Management

- **Local State:**  
  - Managed using Reactâ€™s built-in state management hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`) for component-specific states.

- **Global State:**  
  - **Tool:** Zustand  
  *Rationale:* Zustand is a lightweight and minimalistic state management library that provides an easy-to-use API for managing global state. It is well-suited for handling application-wide states such as user authentication, UI settings, and other shared data. Its simplicity and low overhead make it an ideal choice for our MVP.

- **Server State:**  
  - **Tool:** React Query  
  *Rationale:* React Query is a dedicated library for data fetching, caching, and synchronization. It simplifies handling asynchronous API calls by automatically caching responses, handling background refetching, and managing error states. This makes it a robust and efficient choice for our application's data needs.
